# InventorySystem
This project showcases a business need for keeping track of parts used to create products.

Some items to consider:
  - part dependencies
  - costs
  - searching

Searching is implemented with binary search on each category, for example cost, id, name, etc.

This project could be extended to utilize a database for part management, but was beyond the scope of this project
